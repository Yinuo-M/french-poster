## Installation

1. Clone locally using `git clone https://github.com/Yinuo-M/french-poster.git`
2. Open the french-poster folder
3. Open index.html in a browser
4. Enjoy!

## Challenges and solutions

1. Reproducing the proportions and colours in the poster: I used PhotoShop to take measurement and pinpoint the colours.

2. Creating the black box in the middle: I used the CSS clip-path property to create the black box in the middle of the poster. This produces better result than the alternative, making two parallelograms by applying transform: skew() to two rectangles, because it is difficult to align the bottom right corner of two parallelograms in CSS.

## Disclaimer

I cannot locate the exact font used by the poster so I used a similar sans-serif font, Source Sans Pro.
